# Correlations With Productivity
In October of 2023, Sondre Solstad at The Economist published an article that showed how productivity has grown faster in Western Europe than in the United States ([found here](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/04/productivity-has-grown-faster-in-western-europe-than-in-america)). 
This repo contains the data for an exploratory case study aiming to expand upon the Economist's article and explore potential correlations between a country's productivity and its happiness, CO2 emissions, freedom, and homicide rates over the last 15 years. 

The resulting report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-PzktwLBY5W3-jGo_pqUFPxszGoj1O4qbQdK2_fxKo/edit?usp=sharing)
